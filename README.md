Posture Corrector - The device is a wearable device that connects to an app and also provides real time feedback to the user, including periodic warnings in case of slouching. For this purpose, a microcontroller (ESP32) was used which detects and transmit the way a person is sitting or walking and if he is slouching will gives instantaneous feedback using a vibration motor. The data is sent to an app using a Bluetooth module where the tracking metrics of a person are displayed. A gyroscopic sensor is used to calibrate the position where the person is supposed to be standing straight and the same sensor is then used to track if the person is slouching.
